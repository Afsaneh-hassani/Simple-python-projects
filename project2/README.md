In this program, there is a class of footballers which inherit some features from human class ( Object-Oriented programming).
At the first, we create some footballer objects then we allocate the names of player to each objects. Also with random methods, we divide these names between two teams 'A' and 'B'.
Finally we print the name of player and his team.
